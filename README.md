====

It is difficult to get a credential of AWS when using AssumeRoleWithSAML. This tool simplifies it.

## Requirement

The following operating systems are supported:

- Windows
- macOS
- Linux

And Google Chrome is required.

## Usage

```

options:
  -c, --configure
    Configuration Mode
  -p, --profile string
    AWS profile name (default: "default")
